Bosons make up one of the two classes of [particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle), the other being [fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion).

 

So far, we have some hints and some ideas about what the smallest distance in the universe might be (the Planck length). We have a pretty good catalog of twelve matter particles that so far we havenâ€™t been able to break further apart (the Standard Model). And we have a list of three possible ways that these particles can interact (the electroweak and strong forces and gravity).
